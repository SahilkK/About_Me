# Greetings people😀

I am Sahil, an aspiring Data Scientist with excellent data analysis and data visualization skills, with an avid interest in building unique Machine Learning projects on a frequent basis.

Being a Computer Science Student and a Data-savvy person👨🏻‍💻 from heart, I always had an inclination towards programming in general. Python Programming is at the core of my professional life.

My interest in Data Science🥼 piqued back in 2019 when I was first introduced to the concept and concomitant theory of Machine Learning algorithms via an online learning course.

Since then, my Data Science journey has led me towards a path full of challenges and adversities which made me strong enough to hone my soft skills. I have worked on and analyzed numerous datasets in the past few years.

### "Data Has A Better Idea."

Unscramble and analyze the data to get a clear picture of the story it presents to you - about the past, the present, and the future. Visualize the data to get a better idea of the story it holds within.
